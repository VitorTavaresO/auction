## Its Necessary To Register and Then Make a Login to start using the screens

**DISCLAIMER:** At the moment its only a frontend, so to simulate the database we are using the Local Storage at browser, so if you clean the browser data, it will erase your register data.

### First Screen you will see, click on the register button.
